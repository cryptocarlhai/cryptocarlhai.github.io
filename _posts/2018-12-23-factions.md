# Temple Guardians

The Temple Guardians (also known as Templars) guard the Temple, the largest
gathering place for wizards in the world. They are best at being fast and
aggressive, but they have options for every situation. Many of their cards get
more powerful if their mana cap is an odd number.

# Thieves' Guild

The Thieves' guild are a slow to medium speed, control oriented deck. Their
faction ability allows them to steal enemy face-down cards if they can guess
what they are.

# Mariners

The Mariners are a slow combo-based deck with extremely powerful __Aquatic__
units that can only be used if the battlefield is flooded. You need specific
cards to flood the battlefield, so you'll have to manage your hand carefully.
The Mariner faction ability, which lets you draw 3 cards and put 3 back instead
of your normal draw, can help you do that.

# Faerie Court

The Fae are a fast combo-based deck with an unusual faction ability: They can
keep one card face-down at the start of each of their turns. They also have
__Illusions__, which have much more powerful effects than normal spells; but
unlike normal spells, Illusions can be killed by units.

# Other factions

There are more factions currently in the works. Expect more information here
about House Marshoon and/or Chaos at some point.
