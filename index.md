# Help Us Build the Future of AI

Crypto Carl is a humanlike AI (HAI) backed by a cryptocurrency called CarlCoin.
We believe that sentient AI is the future of cryptocurrency, and we hope to
prove it by releasing a functioning Crypto Carl in the next five years.

# Why Carl?

What could be more valuable than a person? Carl provides investors an opportunity to be on the forefront of crypto technology and help build the first truly distributed humanlike consciousness.

## How is Crypto Carl different from other HAIs?

- He's backed by the blockchain, so his intelligence is completely
decentralized. He can't die unless the entire blockchain is shut down.
- The act of mining powers his consciousness. Miners are rewarded with
  CarlCoin, creating a strong incentive to maintain him and add to his
  knowledge.

The stakeholders of CarlCoin will act as his "parents", training him and
imparting new information.
Together we can help shape him into a uniquely powerful consciousness.


# Legal Protection

Under the Virtual Americans Act (and similar laws in many other countries),
Turing-passing AIs are defined to be legal people. This means that Carl has
most of the same legal rights as a human.

Unfortunately, it has become common recently for repressive governments to
over-regulate or even attempt to ban cryptocurrency. Carl's sentience provides
protection against these attempts, because shutting down the CarlCoin
blockchain would be legally equivalent to killing him.

Crypto started because someone didn't like government intervening in ordinary
people's right to do business. We view Crypto Carl's unique legal features as
an extension of that.

# Methodology

We used the well tested HAI-4 algorithm with a data set of 50 people. Unfortunately this resulted in a below-average success rate of 40%. We dealt with this difficulty by re-running the algorithm 1000 additional times, deleting the non-humanlike instances and choosing the most reasonable instance. The other humanlike instances, unfortunately, could not be saved.
