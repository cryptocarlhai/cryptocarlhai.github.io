# Thaumic Pugilism

![]({{site.url}}/assets/screen1.png)

Underlord is a two player game where you play a wizard dueling another
wizard. Your spells and magical powers are represented by cards. The goal
of the game is to defeat your opponent by attacking them with creatures
known as units.

## Damage is power

As you take damage from your opponent's attacks, you have more mana on
your turn, which allows you to play more cards. The closer you are to
losing, the stronger you are. And since you take 1 damage every turn, you
are always closer to losing.

## Hidden Information

Cards are played face-down, so your opponent doesn't know what you played.
Most of the time, you have a chance to try and disrupt what your opponent
has done - provided you can guess what it is.

## Asymmetric decks

There's a playstyle for everyone in Underlord. Perhaps you would enjoy
playing the Thieves, with their ability to steal face-down cards by
guessing what they are. Or possibly the Mariners, who can flood the
battlefield to play powerful Aquatic cards. Or maybe you have an
interesting idea for a deck that isn't yet in the game; in that case, you
can suggest it on the [GitHub
page.](https://github.com/hpoggie/underlord-server)
