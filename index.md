# Thaumic Pugilism

In late 2016, I decided to take a walk in the woods. As I ventured deeper into
the forest, I began to hear a multitude of angelic voices in the distance.
Suddenly, an eagle surrounded by a ring of flaming eyeballs descended from the
sky and hovered before me. With a thunderous voice, it spoke:

_"I have an idea for a card game."_

It then described its idea to me - a card game both simple and sublime. The
eagle told me that if I made this game, I would go to Valhalla when I died and
feast with my ancestors for all eternity. Then it flew away into the heavens
whence it came.

## This is the game that the eagle described to me.

Underlord is a two player game where you play a wizard dueling another wizard.
Your spells and magical powers are represented by cards. The goal of the game
is to defeat your opponent by attacking them with creatures or beings known as
_units_.

## What does not kill us makes us stronger

As you take damage from your opponent's attacks, you have more _mana_ on your
turn, which allows you to play more cards. The closer you are to losing, the
stronger you are. And since you take 1 damage every turn, you are always closer
to losing.

## Hidden Information

Cards are played face-down, so your opponent doesn't know what you played.
Most of the time, you have a chance to try and disrupt what your opponent
has done - provided you can guess what it is.

## Asymmetric decks

There's a playstyle for everyone in Underlord. Perhaps you would enjoy
playing the Thieves, with their ability to steal face-down cards by
guessing what they are. Or possibly the Mariners, who can flood the
battlefield to play powerful Aquatic cards.
