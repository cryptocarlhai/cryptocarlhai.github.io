# Origin

In late 2016, I decided to take a walk in the woods. As I ventured deeper into
the forest, I began to hear a multitude of angelic voices in the distance.
Suddenly, an eagle surrounded by a ring of flaming eyeballs descended from the
sky and hovered before me. With a thunderous voice, it spoke:

_"I have an idea for a game."_

It then described its idea to me - a card game both simple and sublime.
The eagle told me that if I made this game, I would go to Valhalla when
I died and feast with my ancestors for eternity. Then it flew away into
the heavens whence it came.

## Thaumic Pugilism

Underlord is a two player game where you play a wizard dueling another
wizard. Your spells and magical powers are represented by cards. The goal
of the game is to defeat your opponent by attacking them with creatures
known as units.

## Masochism

As you take damage from your opponent's attacks, you have more mana on
your turn, which allows you to play more cards. The closer you are to
losing, the stronger you are. And since you take 1 damage every turn, you
are always closer to losing.

## Hidden Information

Cards are played face-down, so your opponent doesn't know what you played.
Most of the time, you have a chance to try and disrupt what your opponent
has done - provided you can guess what it is.

## Asymmetric decks

There's a playstyle for everyone in Underlord. Perhaps you would enjoy
playing the Thieves, with their ability to steal face-down cards by
guessing what they are. Or possibly the Mariners, who can flood the
battlefield to play powerful Aquatic cards.

## Intrigued?

If you want to play this game, there will be links to executables here
soonâ„¢. Eventually you will be able to download the source code from GitHub
when the game is made open-source. The plan is to release it under the GPL
and charge for server time.
